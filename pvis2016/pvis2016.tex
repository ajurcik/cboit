%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is

%% submission, ``preprint'' is for pre-publication, and the final version
%% doesn't use a specific qualifier. Further, ``electronic'' includes
%% hyperreferences for more convenient online viewing.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind
%% review process. Some conferences, like IEEE Vis and InfoVis, have NOT
%% in the past.

%% Figures should be in CMYK or Grey scale format, otherwise, colour 
%% shifting may occur during the printing process.

%% These three lines bring in essential packages: ``mathptmx'' for Type 1

%% for proper handling of the times font family.

%% Abstract section.
\abstract{The reactivity of the biomolecular structures is highly influenced by their structural features. 
Thus, studying these features along with the exploration of their dynamic behavior helps to understand the processes ongoing in living cells.
This can be reached by the visual representation of these processes as visualization is one of the most natural ways to convey such information.
However, none of the currently available techniques provides the biochemists with an intuitive real-time representation of the dynamic movements of molecules and precise geometrical based extraction of their structural features performed instantly.
In this paper we introduce such a technique enabling the user to compute and also to visualize the molecular surface along with inner voids.
To obtain a better insight into the molecule, our technique enables to visualize the molecular surface transparently. 
The opacity can be adjusted by changing user-defined parameters in order to enhance the perception of the surfaces of inner voids.
%The whole visualization is created in a focus and context visualization manner, where the user can interactively choose the structures of interest.
All integrated algorithms run in real-time which gives the user a big variety of exploration possibilities.
The importance of our approach is even amplified with respect to the fact that currently the size of molecular dynamics simulations is increasing dramatically and offline rendering thus becomes impracticable. 
The usability of our technique was evaluated by the domain experts.
