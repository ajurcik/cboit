%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
The reactivity of the biomolecular structures is highly influenced by the presence of an inside void space. 
Thus, studying the inner void space along with the exploration their dynamic behavior helps to understand the processes ongoing in all living cells.
This can be reached by the visual representation of this process as visualization is one of the most natural ways to convey such information.
However, none of the currently available systems provides the biochemists with an intuitive real-time representation of the dynamic movements of molecules and extraction of their inner void space. 
In this paper we introduce such system which enables the user to compute and visualize the molecular surface and inner cavities instantly.
Moreover, to obtain a better insight into the molecule, we propose a technique that allows us to the visualize the molecular surface transparently. 
The whole visualization system is created in a focus and context visualization manner, where a user can interactively choose the structures of interest.
All integrated algorithms run in real-time which gives the user a big variety of exploration possibilities.
The importance of our system is even amplified with respect to the fact that in recent years the size of molecular dynamics simulations increases dramatically and offline rendering thus becomes very impracticable. 
We present the usability of our system by a case study which reflects the real problem of the domain experts.
