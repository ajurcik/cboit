Orignal structure complexity is $|A| \cdot maxNeighbors^2$ where $maxNeighbors = 64$.

Our structure complexity is $|T| + hashFreeRatio \cdot 3 |T|$ where $hashFreeRatio = 2$.

The ratio of atoms to triangles is approximately (value from experiments) $\frac{|A|}{|T|} > \frac{1}{4}$ so that $\frac{|A| \cdot maxNeighbors^2}{|T|(1 + 3 \cdot hashFreeRatio)} > \frac{64^2}{28} > 146$ which means that the original structure is more than 100 times larger for only 64 neighbors. Actually, our maximum neighbor count is 128, to be able to compute surface of molecules that contain hydrogens.
