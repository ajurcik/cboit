In this section we describe our approach to the extraction of molecular surface and surfaces of inner cavities which we denote as surface features.
First we present the algorithms for the computation of molecular surfaces and cavities and then we show how we deal with special cases occurring within the surface construction.

%Extended CB Algorithm
\subsection{Surface computation}
\label{sec:ecb}
Our surface computation algorithm is based on the existing approach that utilizes the GPU capabilities~\cite{krone2011parallel}.
In the former study, the SES is represented using three different sets of shapes -- spheres, toroidal saddles, and spherical triangles depicted by red, blue, and green colors in Fig.~\ref{fig:cb-oit} (left).
%, that are ray-casted to obtain opaque surface visualization. 
%While ray-casting spheres and tori, some sections of the final image will be later occluded by the spherical triangles.
%However, rendering these primitives opaquely produces pixels that are not visible in the final image due to their occlusion by other surface pixels (Fig.~\ref{fig:cb-oit}).
However, rendering these shapes produces unnecessary pixels located below the surface of the molecule.
As we aim for transparent surface visualization, these interior pixels are becoming unwanted.
Therefore, we extended the existing algorithm that it computes the following SES patches:
i) \textit{spherical triangles}, as were already described by Krone et al.~\cite{krone2011parallel} and Lindow et al.~\cite{lindow2010accelerated},
ii) \textit{toroidal patches}, delimited by two spherical triangles, and
iii) \textit{spherical patches}, enclosed by edges of two or more toroidal patches.
%\textcolor{red}{JP: This needs to be explained: Therefore, to visualize contour surface representation using transparency}, we extended the algorithm so that it computes a SES represented with:
%\begin{itemize}
	%\item Spherical triangles.
  %\item Toroidal patches -- a toroidal patch is delimited by two spherical triangles.
	%\item Spherical patches -- a spherical patch is enclosed by edges of three or more toroidal patches.
%\end{itemize}

%More, our algorithm is also able to handle patches on a sphere that form different surfaces, i.e., the outer and one or more inner.
}
\label{fig:cb-oit}
\end{figure}

In comparison with the previous solution, our main contribution here lies in the computation of toroidal and spherical patches.
By using them we avoid the situation when the previous algorithm renders the parts of tori and spheres which do not form the final surface (Fig.~\ref{fig:cb-oit}).


%Regarding tori, Kauker et al.~\cite{kauker2013rendering} proposed to ray-cast a toroidal patch using a torus and two clipping planes defined by its delimiting triangles.

%\caption{Ray-tracing of a toroidal patch. The saddle part of the torus (a) is cut by so called \textit{visibility sphere}.
%A patch (b) is cut from the whole toroidal ring by clipping planes.}
%\end{figure}

%We employ his approach and modify the data structure that is used in the original algorithm to store spherical triangles in such a way that we are able to obtain all triangles incident to a torus.
%In this way, we ray-cast toroidal patches directly instead of tori.
%In order to get all neighboring triangles for a torus, we hash the triangles by three keys -- one for each torus which is connected to a triangle.
%For this, we implemented a simple hash table (see Figure~\ref{fig:hashing}) which is based on linear addressing scheme \cite{alcantara2011efficient}.

%	\label{fig:hashing}
%\end{figure}

To be able to compute the toroidal patches, we employ a hash data structure that enables us to store and retrieve all spherical triangles incident to a torus (Fig.~\ref{fig:hashing41}). 
%In order to get all neighboring triangles for a torus, 
We hash the triangles by three keys, i.e., one for each torus which is connected to a triangle.
For this purpose, we implemented a simple hash table, which is based on linear addressing scheme~\cite{alcantara2011efficient}.
We compute toroidal patches on a torus by retrieving all its neighboring triangles and sorting them relatively by their angular position around the torus axis.
Since the number of neighboring triangles of a torus is low (for molecules with {\tweakedsim}10,000 atoms we obtained maximally 8 of them) we employ the bubble sort algorithm for their sorting.
After sorting, the pairs of neighboring triangles define the toroidal patches and the corresponding edges.
Additionally, we check whether the first two triangles form a visible patch.
If not, then the first triangle forms a visible patch with the last one and we rotate the sorted list of triangles by one item.

This allows us to ray-cast the toroidal patches separately instead of the whole tori.

	\label{fig:hashing41}
\end{figure}



As already described, a spherical patch is bounded by toroidal patches (Fig.~\ref{fig:graph}). 
We extended the surface computation algorithm by adding three new GPU kernels that compute the sets of toroidal patches forming the spherical patches (see Sec.~\ref{sec:graph}).
When rendering the surface, each set is used to ray-cast a spherical patch (see Sec.~\ref{sec:spherical-patches}).

%Surface graph
\subsection{Cavity computation}
\label{sec:graph}
   
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Idea: computed surfaces are continuous (closed) and graphs of their primitives form isolated components in the whole graph of all surface primitives
%  \item Modification of parallel CB of Krone et. al --- aaaa
%  \item Extension of parallel CB of Krone et. al --- 3 new kernels:
%	\begin{enumerate}
%	  \item Adjacency matrix is built (only 3 edges at each vertex)
%    \item Labeling of connected components (parallel BFS --- suboptimal)
%    \item Circles of edges for each spherical patch are computed
%  \end{enumerate}
%  \item Assign spheres with edges
%  \item Detect circles in edges --- bubble sort $O(n^2)$
%  \item Step 3 --- one sphere can form two or more surfaces
%  \item Rendering of spherical patches --- spherical polygons
%  \item Odd-even rule + point outside polygon
%  \item Special case: isolated tori
%\end{itemize}

The computed surface contains patches of both the outer molecular surface and the surfaces of inner cavities.
%\footnote{\textcolor{red}{JP: This should be written in more friendly fashion and with clear defined terms. Terms to be explained: surface is continuitous (geometrical?, since $C^1$ continuous it is not), graphs (2D/3D, does it contain loops?), primitive, component}}
Kauker et al. \cite{kauker2013rendering} aimed at visualizing the outer surface solely.
%\footnote{\textcolor{red}{AJ: Maybe, this could be part of related work}}
Therefore, they call the inner parts of the surface as inner remains as they represent the source of occlusion.
However, in our case the inner cavities are important as well.
%because of their significant role in the reactivity of the molecule.
%We think that for SES, the user might want to visualize cavities within the molecule and hence it is useful to let him decide on what to visualize.
Additionally, it is advantageous for the user to have the option to visualize both molecular surface and inner cavities and interactively alter between both of them, i.e., the cavities can be shown or hidden on demand.
%Contrary, for SAS, the cavities are visualized much smaller than in the case of SES and therefore visualizing them does not help assessing their shape or volume.
%The difference \textcolor{red}{stems from} the definitions of the surfaces.
%In the case of SAS, we therefore propose to clip the inner surfaces to enhance the visualization.

%The user might also want to hide cavities inside a SES to lower possible occlusion of other structures such as tunnels or cartoons.



Hiding the cavities is straightforward, since their surface is completely separated from the molecular surface.
%\textcolor{red}{\cite{borland2011ambient}}.
%\footnote{\textcolor{red}{JP: Too many ideas in one sentence. Split into two or more.}}
More specifically, one component represents the outer molecular surface and each single cavity corresponds to another component.
%For the contour representation of the surface, 
Such independent components can be easily detected by applying connected component (CC) analysis to a structure which we call the \textit{surface graph}.
%\footnote{\textcolor{red}{JP: Introduce here "terminus techniques"; i.e., SES is composed of three types of patches etc.}}
We define the surface graph using the triangles representing vertices and the toroidal patches representing edges 
%since each toroidal patch is delimited by two triangles\
(Fig.~\ref{fig:graph}).
In this graph, all the vertices are of degree three.
In fact, the surface graph is an analogy to the graph of SAS (solvent-accessible surface) contours~\cite{totrov1996contour}.

\begin{figure}[bht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3.3in]{image/graph.png}
  \caption{Illustration of the surface graph construction.
	Triangles form vertices and toroidal patches form edges between them.
	Spherical patches are represented as cycles in the graph.}
	\label{fig:graph}
\end{figure}
%\footnote{\textcolor{red}{I don't understand the following sentence. What is former graph representation? The whole sentence should be rewritten.}}
%Moreover, using the former graph representation makes also the implementation of used graph algorithms and graph data structures on the GPU easier.

Finally, the surface contains also tori that are not bounded by any triangles.
We call these tori \textit{isolated} since they do not have any neighboring triangles (Fig.~\ref{fig:isolated-hole}).
The isolated tori are excluded from the surface graph and are handled later in the computation (see Sec.~\ref{sec:isolated}).

%\subsubsection{Extraction of surfaces}

%To extract the surfaces, i.e., the outer surface and the surfaces of the cavities, we build a \textit{surface graph} from the computed surface and apply the CC analysis to it.
The whole computation is done on the GPU in order to avoid additional data transfers between the main memory and the graphics card.
%\footnote{\textcolor{red}{Input, output}}
We split the analysis of the surface into three steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Building the adjacency list of surface graph $G = (E, V)$.
	\item Finding all connected components of $G$.
	\item Finding cycles in $G$ that represent patches on spheres.
\end{enumerate}

For each step, we introduce a GPU kernel implemented as a GLSL compute shader.
%In details, our algorithm works as follows.
%First, we modified the output of the original GPU parallel CB to obtain the input which is needed for the analysis and rendering of transparent toroidal patches.

First, we build the adjacency list of $G$ from the set of edges $E$.
We store the adjacency list of $G$ as a $|V| \times 3$ matrix, since each vertex has three neighbors.
%To build $G$, we utilize the hash table of triangles.
In fact, $E$ is prepared earlier in the surface computation phase, when we compute the toroidal patches for ray-casting.
To compute these patches, we determine their delimiting triangles, thus knowing incident vertices of edges of $G$.
%\textcolor{red}{In the hash table, each triangle is hashed using all three pairs of spheres -- $(i, j)$, $(i, k)$ and $(j, k)$ that produced it.
%To retrieve a triangle for a torus, we query the hash table with a pair of its neighboring spheres as a key.}
%and therefore we also write edges for these patches into $E$.
For each non-isolated toroidal patch an edge $e$ is added to $E$ by writing its incident vertices into a buffer of edges.
%Here, we find the incident vertices of $e$ by querying the hash table of triangles.
%In the original algorithm \cite{krone2011parallel}, an arc intersection was stored only for atoms whose indices fulfilled $i < j < k$.
%This is insufficient for rendering the toroidal patches transparent as they can't be rendered as a one whole patch because the parts that would be hidden by the opaque surface would be visible.
%Instead, we split each torus into its visible patches based on their neighboring triangles that delimit them.
%Since each torus is defined by a small circle between atoms $i$ and $j$, we are interested in all triangles that were produced by atoms $i$, $j$ and some other atom $k$.
%\textcolor{red}{For this purpose, we store the computed arc intersections in a linear buffer (employing atomics) and together produce a hash structure which enables us to find the triangles by their two of the three atom indices.
%Consequently, we save GPU memory because the original arcs structure was sparse (see Appendix ?).
%Now, we store n arcs together with $3 n$ keys in a hash table which data/free ratio is 2. \textcolor{red}{TODO: More precision.}}
The first kernel then transforms the buffer of edges $E$ into a matrix representing the adjacency list of $G$.
The matrix has one row for each vertex $v \in V$ which stores neighbors of $v$ as indices into the buffer of vertices $V$.
%The matrix contains one row for each vertex, i.e., triangle, and three columns for its three neighbors, i.e., toroidal patches.%, because each triangle has exactly (at most?) three neighboring toroidal patches in the surface.

In the second step, all connected components of $G$ are found and labeled using the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.
%Our implementation of the BFS algorithm is suboptimal, because its time complexity is $O(d \cdot n)$ where d is the length of the longest shortest path among all vertices in a component.
%In the worst case, d can be n.
We opt for a simple, quadratic-work implementation~\cite{merrill2012scalable}, because of the ability to have the BFS implemented in a single kernel.
Our decision is supported by the performance measurements (see Sec.~\ref{sec:performance}) where the computation of surface components takes {\tweakedsim}5 ms for a molecule with {\tweakedsim}10,000 atoms while the computation of SES and its ray-casting together takes {\tweakedsim}41 ms.

In the last step, the cycles representing the spherical patches are extracted.
To do this, we assign the edges in $E$ by their neighboring spheres into buckets.
We then order the edges in buckets by their adjacency, so that they represent one or more cycles in $G$.
A spherical patch is labeled by the label of any of its delimiting edges.

\subsubsection{Special case -- Isolated torus}
\label{sec:isolated}

We handle the isolated tori in two steps.
First, a label for a torus is retrieved. 
Note that an isolated torus is not a part of the surface graph.
Second, for each isolated torus, we clip fragments in its neighboring spherical patches that are overlaid by the torus. 
Otherwise, these fragments would create a false surface layer between a torus and a spherical patch (Fig.~\ref{fig:isolated-hole}).

\begin{figure}[htp]

    \includegraphics[height=1.4in]{image/isolated-hole.png}
    %\caption{A hole in a spherical patch.}
  \end{subfigure}
\caption{Example of an isolated torus between two spheres.
	Left: isolated tori (yellow) do not have any neighboring triangles. Therefore, the surface component to which they belong cannot be determined directly from the surface graph. Right: an isolated torus cuts circular holes in its neighboring spherical patches.}
\label{fig:isolated-hole}
\end{figure}

An isolated torus can be encountered while writing the toroidal patches for ray-casting.
We add this torus into the buffer for ray-casting and we also mark it for later processing.
Later on, when the detection of surface components is done, we run another kernel which assigns the isolated tori to their surface labels.
The assignment is done by inspecting the neighboring spheres of the tori.
There can be two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item One of the spheres forms only one patch. Then the torus lies in the same surface component as this patch.
	\item Both spheres form two or more patches. We find a neighboring patch of the torus by employing the point in a spherical patch test (see Sec.~\ref{sec:spherical-patches}). Then the torus lies in the same surface component as its neighboring patch.
\end{enumerate}

The clipping of fragments in the affected spherical patches can be reached using a clipping plane or a \textit{visibility sphere} (introduced in~\cite{krone2009interactive}) of a torus.
We use the latter approach, since the visibility spheres for tori were already computed in a previous phase of our technique.
Here, our kernel writes a texture, similarly to Krone et al.~\cite{krone2011parallel}, which stores all visibility spheres that intersect the sphere.
When ray-casting spherical patches, we use this texture to discard all fragments that are inside of the intersecting visibility sphere.

\subsubsection{Special case -- Intersecting surfaces}
\label{sec:intersecting}
The SES surface, more specifically its part that is formed by spherical triangles, can intersect itself.
These self-intersections were solved by Krone et. al~\cite{krone2009interactive}.
In our case, we compute one or more SES surfaces that can mutually intersect in the same way.
We handle two different cases of such surface-surface intersections:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The outer surface is intersected by a cavity. We clip only the surface of the cavity to prevent the outer surface from containing holes.
	\item A cavity is intersected by another cavity that will not be visible. We do not clip the visible cavity, otherwise we would create a hole in its surface.
\end{itemize}
We implemented the handling of these two cases by extending the self-intersections handling algorithm described in~\cite{krone2011parallel}.
