The exploratory process of MD simulations is often concerned with the visual identification of binding sites of ligands to a host macromolecule.
These sites represent a molecular surface feature known as cavities, pockets or as tunnels.
There is a legacy of tools and approaches that allow us to extract these features.
Two major challenges in regards to the surface features, i.e., for instance cavities, are their fast extraction and their visualization in the most informative manner. This is especially crucial when analyzing MD simulations containing thousands of frames.

There are several types of molecular surface representation proposed in the literature~\cite{START2015}. Nevertheless, for cavity analysis,  the solvent-excluded surface (SES) belongs to the most used representation\cite{todo} amongst biologists. This representation allows us to directly asses whether a solvent, approximated a sphere of a certain radius, is able to reach a binding site of interest on the molecular surface. Such a binding site is located inside a cavity or a tunnel, while the molecular surface might contain tens of cavities per a single simulation snap-shot. Additionally, computation of SES is not a trivial task, which also requires a substantial computation and algorithmic capabilities. Therefore, it would be essential to posses a technique that could provide us an instant computation and an interactive and meaningful visualization of the cavities in the context of molecular surface.

In this paper, we introduce visualization technique that enables to ...
