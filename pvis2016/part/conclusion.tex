Future work
\begin{itemize}
  \item More tight bounds for ray-casting may further improve the performance. This holds especially for tori because each torus is ray-casted xxx (about 2) times in average. (AJ)
  \item The ray-casting could be done using OpenCL which could lower bandwidth because the data common to many fragments could be fetched only once and shared using local (shared) memory. (AJ)
	\item Transfer function.
\end{itemize}
