In this paper we presented our approach to the real-time computation and visualization of the transparent molecular surface and inner cavities which is based on an accelerated and improved rendering pipeline.
We also improved the existing state-of-the-art method to the SES computation by proposing new methods for computation and rendering of individual SES patches.
The usability of our solution was tested by the domain experts. 
They also revealed possible extensions of our solution which are discussed as well.
Other possible extensions are related to the performance, which can be improved, for instance, using more tight bounds for ray-casting.
