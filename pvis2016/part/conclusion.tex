In this paper we presented an accelerated and improved rendering pipeline for the real-time computation and visualization of the transparent molecular surface and inner cavities.
We also improved the existing state-of-the-art method to the SES computation by proposing new method for computation and rendering of individual SES patches.
The usability of our solution was tested by the domain experts. 
They also revealed possible extensions of our solution which are discussed as well.
Other possible extensions are related to the performance and the accuracy.
