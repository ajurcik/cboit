\begin{itemize}
  \item Performance drop of SES rendering on newer hardware (GF 680 GTX) --- we can perform better. We contacted authors, they do not know exactly why, they think it is change in the internal architecture between Fermi and Kepler (AJ)
  \item Slow rendering of SAS. Too many layers in pixels --- we can do better by surface layers detection (AJ)
\end{itemize}

There are more solutions taken from computer graphics; e.g., OIT (JP)
